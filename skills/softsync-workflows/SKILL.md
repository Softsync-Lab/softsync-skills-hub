# Workflows

Workflows are automations built in the app. There are two kinds you can run from here.

## Manual workflows (most common)
The ones people start by hand in the app.
1. `list_runnable_workflows`: names, descriptions and the input each one needs.
2. `start_workflow_run` with the workflowName and that input. If input is missing, the error lists what to ask the user for.
3. `get_workflow_run_status_by_id` with the runId until it finishes, then read its output.

## Published workflows
Workflows published as API endpoints, identified by a slug.
- `list_published_workflows`, then `run_published_workflow`. Short runs return the result; long runs return a runId for `get_workflow_run_status_by_id`.

## Rules
- Only pass input the workflow declares. Ask the user for anything missing.
- A workflow can change records or send messages. Tell the user what it will do and confirm before running it.
- Some workspaces also publish individual workflows as their own tools; use those the same way.
